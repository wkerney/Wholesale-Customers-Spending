The UCI Wholesale customers dataset is provided by the University of California at Irvine, it refers to clients
of a wholesale distributor. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product
categories. What we are doing today is using this data to analyze some customer spending patterns and
derive some insights. Additionally, I added an EDA I did using SQLite in Posit Cloud to take a closer look at the data.
